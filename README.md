# Dinosaurs Island

This is the final project for the Computer Software Engineering Bachelor's Degree of the Polytechnic University of Milan for the academic year 2010/2011 developed by Sergio Andaloro and Gioele Antoci.

Dinosaurs' Island (L'isola dei dinosauri) is an adaptation of the Facebook engineering puzzle "Dinosaur Island" specifically developed for the final exam of Software Engineering which results in the Bachelor's Thesis. The outcome is an application fully written in Java with both a client and a server component both working using either sockets or RMI. The game is turn based and takes place on a map composed by tiles that can be water, vegetation or contain a carcass. Each user has to manage a dinosaur's species with the goal to prevent its extinction.

The game is divided into two main components: a client and a server. The server operates both via socket and RMI at the same time and can manage multiple clients connecting to it via both methods.
