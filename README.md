# DinosaursIsland
Dinosaurs' Island (L'isola dei dinosauri) is an adaptation of the Facebook engineering puzzle "Dinosaur Island" specifically developed for the final exam of Software Engineering which results in the Bachelor's Thesis. The outcome is an application fully written in Java with both a client and a server component both working using either sockets or RMI. The game is turn based and takes place on a map composed by tiles that can be water, vegetation or contain a carcass. Each user has to manage a dinosaur's species with the goal to prevent its extinction.
